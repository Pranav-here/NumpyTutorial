# Numpy is a python library used to work with arrays
# Numpy stands for Numeric Python

# We have NumPy's because lists are slow to process: NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

# The Array object in Numpy is ndarray
